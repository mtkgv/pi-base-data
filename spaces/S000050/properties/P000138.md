Let $X$ be {S50}, and $f : X \to X$ be continuous.

Denote $f(\infty) = p$. and let $\{I_n\}$ be a sequence of open subsets of $X$ which decrease to $p$.
(These could be, for example, the open intervals $(p - \tfrac{1}{n}, p + \tfrac{1}{n})$.)

Since $f$ is continuous, each $f^{-1}(I_n)$ is open.
Moreover, since $f(\infty) = p$, each $f^{-1}(I_n)$ contains $\infty$.
Thus by the definition of $X$, each $f^{-1}(I_n) = X$.

Now, suppose on the contrary there exists a point $q$ in $X$ such that
$f(q) \neq p$.
Then by the construction of $\{I_n\}$ there exists some $N$ for which
$f(q) \notin I_n$ when $n \geq N$.
As a result, $q \notin f^{-1}(I_n)$ for $n \geq N$, which implies
$f^{-1}(I_n) \neq X$ for $n \geq N$. 
This contradicts the previous paragraph, so we must have $f(q) = p$ for all $q \in X$.

Consequently, this shows that every continuous $f : X \to X$ is of the
form $f(q) = p$, where $p$ is a constant.
Thus $f$ is entirely defined by the choice of $p$, and since {S50|P57}, there are countably many options for $p$.

Hence, {S50|P138}.
